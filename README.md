# Langcab

This is an Angular based web UI for an App that can capture your vocabulary and uses a spaced repetition algorythm to help you train it.

## Choice for Angular

This project was originally written in Angular Dart. However unfortunately Google slowly dropped
support for Angular Dart. However Angular is currently still the best scaling web framework and
comes wich TS which is still better than JS. 

Also the Material design can be used easily with Angular.

## Run project locally
