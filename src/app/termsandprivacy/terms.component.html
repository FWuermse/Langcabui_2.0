        <u>MISCELLANEOUS. </u>These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and Langcab regarding your use of the Site,
        superseding any prior agreements between you and Langcab on the subject matter (including, but not limited to, any prior versions of the Terms of
        Use). In the event that any provision of these Terms of Use conflicts with the law under which these Terms of Use are to be construed or if any such
        provision is held invalid or unenforceable by a court with jurisdiction over the parties, such provision shall be deemed to be restated to reflect as
        nearly as possible the economic effect of the original provision in accordance with applicable law.  The remaining provisions of these Terms of Use and
        the application of the challenged provision to persons or circumstances other than those as to which it is invalid or unenforceable shall not be
        affected thereby, and each such provision shall be valid and enforceable to the full extent permitted by law.  These Terms of Use are governed by the
        laws of the United States and the State of New York, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of laws. Unless waived in its sole discretion
        by Langcab, the sole jurisdiction and venue for actions related to the subject matter hereof will be the New York state and federal courts having
        within their jurisdiction the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York and both parties consent to the jurisdiction of such courts.  The official
        language for this Agreement, and of any proceedings and writings amending or interpreting this Agreement, will be English. The parties specifically
        disclaim the U.N. Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.
